## A Yoga Teacher by day ☼ and an aspiring data analyst by night ☾

Originally from Poland, now based in the UK, I have a background in psychology and research and am currently expanding my skills in data analytics with Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

What I’m Working On  
🔹 Developing my data analysis & visualisation skills through hands-on projects.  
🔹 Collaborating on real-world data projects to gain practical experience.  
🔹 Exploring ways to combine behavioural insights with data-driven decision-making.  

Outside of Data & Research  
📍 Avid traveller - always happy to swap travel tips (ask me about Indonesia!).  
📸 Creative at heart - into photography, dancing, and painting (and probably picking up a new hobby soon).
