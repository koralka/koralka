## Data Analyst by day ☼ and a yoga teacher by night ☾

Originally from Poland, now based in the UK, I have a background in psychology and research and currently work as a BI Analyst.

What I’m Working On  
🔹 Improving my data analysis & visualisation skills.    
🔹 Exploring ways to combine behavioural insights with data-driven decision-making.  

Outside of Data & Research  
📍 Avid traveller - always happy to swap travel tips (ask me about Indonesia!).  
📸 Creative at heart - into photography, dancing, and painting (and probably picking up a new hobby soon).
